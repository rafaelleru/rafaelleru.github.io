This was caused because airflow is also a package that is installed in my virtualenv, so jedi was not able to discover definitions for example.
That was caused because in my PYTHONPATH airflow was a package, so jedi was not looking into the airflow folder for more source code, causing LSP functionality to not work fine.</description></item></channel></rss>
