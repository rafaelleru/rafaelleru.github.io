<p>I have been comparing multiple versions of the same JSON file in my daily workflow, having to edit it and converting it from one line to pretty and vice-versa. For that purpose, I was copying the JSON to a web called <a href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">JSON formatter and validator</a> (There are hundreds of webs with the same objective around in the web) and then comparing it to his also prettified version using <a href="http://www.jsondiff.com/">JSON diff</a>. This consisted of 4 copy-paste operations all of them involving the mouse. This is slow and tedious and I knew it could be done with vim, but I was lazy about learning how to do it, but I finally did it. On the way, I also started playing around with vim tabs.</p>
<p><img src="./img/05-07-2021/demo.gif" alt="Demo"></p>
<h1 id="1-prettify-a-json-buffer-in-vim">1 Prettify a JSON buffer in VIM.</h1>
<p>There are hundreds of plugins that can do that in VIM with one simple command, but I was already using jq as my goto JSON tool in the CLI and then I found that you can pipe a whole VIM buffer into any program that you like, so I ended up with the following command: <code>:%!jq '.'</code>.
The <code>%</code> symbol represents the content of the current buffer, <code>!</code> passes the previous text to an external program, in this case, <code>jq</code>. Finally jq knows how to prettify a JSON for us, the  <code>'.'</code> final in the command can be omitted, it is only some standard stuff for the pretty JSON format.</p>
<h2 id="2-enabling-diff-for-2-splitted-windows-in-vim">2 Enabling diff for 2 splitted windows in vim</h2>
<p>I knew VIM comes with a diff mode. It can be enabled with the command <code>:windo diffthis</code>. <code>:windo</code> will execute the following command in all windows in a VIM tab. The command I am using is diffthis, which adds the current window to the list of &ldquo;diffs windows&rdquo;. You can also run <code>:diffthis</code> in multiple windows separately and it will give you the diff of those windows.</p>
<h2 id="3-opening-new-buffers-with-enew">3 Opening new buffers with <code>:enew</code></h2>
<p>If we have let&rsquo;s say a dataset with hundreds of JSONs inside it will be so tedious to check the diff for all of the entries, so I usually open a new unnamed buffer with <code>:enew</code> and paste inside the JSON that I want to check.</p>
<p>So to compare 2 JSONs side by side this is the whole command sequence you need to run:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>:tabnew</code> (I like to perform this kind of operations in a new tab)</li>
<li>Paste your first json from another buffer.</li>
<li><code>:vsplit</code></li>
<li><code>:enew</code></li>
<li><code>:windo %!jq</code> This will format both buffers simultaneously.</li>
<li><code>:windo diffthis</code></li>
<li><code>:tabcl</code> to close up the tab, once you have finished checking and editing your jsons.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will not use anymore tools like the 2 webs named at the begining of this article, I hope you neither, VIM
can manage this and much more!</p>
